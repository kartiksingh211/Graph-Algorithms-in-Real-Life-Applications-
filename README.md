##  Overview
This project demonstrates how classical **graph algorithms** are applied to real-world scenarios.  
The notebook implements and analyzes four problems:

| No. | Problem | Algorithm | Type |
|-----|----------|------------|------|
| 1️ | Social Network Friend Suggestion | BFS / DFS | Unweighted Graph |
| 2️ | Route Finding (Google Maps) | Bellman–Ford | Weighted Directed Graph |
| 3️ | Emergency Response Routing | Dijkstra’s Algorithm | Weighted Graph (Positive Edges) |
| 4️ | Network Cable Installation | Minimum Spanning Tree (Kruskal / Prim) | Undirected Weighted Graph |

Each problem includes:
- Python implementation  
- Realistic sample graph data  
- Profiling (time and memory)    
- Analysis of complexity and scalability

##  How to Run (Google Colab / Local)
###  On Google Colab
1. Upload the notebook file `graph_realworld.ipynb` to Colab.  
2. Run the setup cell (install dependencies):  
   ```python
   !pip install matplotlib networkx memory_profiler
